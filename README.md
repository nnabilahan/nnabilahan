ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Muhammad Makbul N (mkeyzxi)
I'm a Junior Web Developer based in South Sulawesi, currently studying Informatics Engineering at the Alauddin State Islamic University, Makassar (Class of 2022). I'm passionate about technology and always eager to learn new tools and frameworks. I enjoy building modern, efficient, and scalable web applications and am constantly improving my coding skills to deliver user-friendly solutions.

ðŸŒ± Tech Enthusiast
I explore not only web development but also the fundamentals of other programming languages like C++, Kotlin, and Python. Additionally, I'm diving into fields such as IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence), where I experiment with various projects and technologies. I am also like about Proxmox, Ubuntu Server, Virtual Machines, and using remote server tools like PuTTY to access and manage remote servers securely.
